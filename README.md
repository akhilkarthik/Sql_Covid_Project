COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Overview
This SQL project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data, covering various aspects such as deaths, cases, vaccinations, and population. The goal is to derive meaningful insights and trends to better understand the impact of the pandemic across countries and continents.

Queries Breakdown
1. Data Importing:
Two datasets, covid_death and Vaccination, are imported to gather information on COVID-19 cases and vaccinations.
2. Data Selection and Order:
Relevant data is selected, ensuring no null values in the "continent" column, and the results are ordered by specified columns.
3. COVID-19 Metrics:
Queries examine total cases, total deaths, death percentage, cases per population, and various metrics to understand the impact of the virus on different locations.
4. Continent-wise Analysis:
The project breaks down data by continents, revealing the continents with the highest death counts.
5. Global Numbers:
Global metrics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages, provide an overview of the overall impact of the pandemic.
6. Vaccination Data Integration:
Queries integrate vaccination data, showcasing the relationship between population, new vaccinations, and the rolling count of people vaccinated.
7. Temporary Table and Views:
A temporary table is created to store and organize data, and views are established for simplified visualization.

Key Observations
The project explores patterns of COVID-19 metrics at the global, country, and continent levels.
Vaccination data is incorporated to understand the relationship between vaccination efforts and COVID-19 metrics.
Temporary tables and views enhance data organization for better analysis and visualization.
